# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this post, I'll share my experience building modern web applications with the latest version of Next.js.

## Key Features

### 1. Server Actions
Server Actions allow you to write server-side code directly in your React components. This eliminates the need for separate API routes in many cases.

### 2. Partial Prerendering
This new rendering model combines static and dynamic content seamlessly, improving both performance and user experience.

### 3. Improved Development Experience
The development server is now faster than ever, with better error handling and debugging capabilities.

## Best Practices

1. Use Server Components by default
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Optimize images with next/image
4. Leverage the App Router for better organization

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 is a game-changer for web development, making it easier than ever to build fast, scalable applications.
